# website-template
Website template that features the use of 3 additional animation libraries in JavaScript.
These libraries include GSAP, ScrollMagic, and Barba.

GSAP: Is used to create a reveal and hide image effect when the user is scrolling through the website. It is also used to create a smooth change to the nav-header elements when navigation bars have been clicked/initiated.

ScrollMagic: Used to manipulate objects on the screen by bringing them into focus while scrolling is occurring.

Barba: Used for page transitions and holding over elements from original index to fashion index to create a seamless moving effect.

Website is responsive and has been modified with the lowest value established at 1024px width.


Issues/Concerns:
At this time the fill effect established by GSAP on the main index page works only on dark modes, I am looking into understand how the fill effect can work on websites with a lighter background color.
